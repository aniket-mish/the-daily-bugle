# The Daily ðŸ•¸ Bugle

I'm building a comic nerd app that answers my nerdy questions about superheroes. This keeps track of all the superhero stuff going on in the world. You can ask trivia things including coolest easter eggs. I am also reading about LLMOps and AI Engineering.

My project map:
- ~Setup and installations~
- Collect data
- Fine-tune an open source llm
- Vector db
- Query the system with prompts
- Create a simple ui

## Index

1. Data Collection
2. Feature Engineering
3. Training/Finetuning a LLM
4. Inference Service
5. Monitoring
6. UI/UX

## Setup

### Environment

I am using `conda` for creating environments.

```bash
conda create -n comic python=3.11

conda activate comic
```

I am using `poetry` for package management. I will use `uv` in production because its very fast.

```
cd comic

poetry init

poetry add numpy pandas
```

### Dependencies

Instead of using `Makefile` for simple automation, i'm using [poe the poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) plugin. I can just add the scripts in the `pyproject.toml` file and execute them. It works well with poetry.

I'm using ZenML as an orchestrator to manage my pipelines. It glues multiple `@step`s with a `@pipeline`. There are other orchestrators like Airflow, Prefect, Argo, Kubeflow that are popular.

Track experiments using CometML and prompts using Opik.

MongoDB for storing scraped data and Qdrant for storing vector representations.

Finally I'm using AWS Sagemaker for training as i'm more familiar with it. You can use AWS Bedrock as well and you don't have to manage infra.
